This example demonstrates a potential issue in F# when working with mutable variables and references. The code attempts to modify a mutable variable indirectly through a reference. While seemingly straightforward, this approach can lead to unexpected behavior or errors if not handled carefully. The solution shows how to address this issue and provide a clear and safer way to modify mutable variables.
